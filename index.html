  <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
  <p>Hello, my name is <strong>Swasthika Rajendran</strong>. This is my GitHub Pages site for BDA594.</p>

  <h2>My Selected Dataset</h2>
  <p> SDRDL is a valuable local data hub full of socioeconomic datasets and tools for San Diego.I find it interesting to see the collections like <strong>Homelessness</strong>,<strong>Urban Planning</strong>, or <strong>Crime Data</strong>.</em>.</p>

  <h2>My Selected Data Science Book</h2>
  <p>"Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything" by Jeffrey Needham.The book took a new and complicated subject and made it easy for many people to understand. It also correctly predicted how data would change businesses and industries. Even now, it’s useful both as a beginner’s guide to big data and as a record of how people first started thinking about the data-driven future we live in today.</p>
