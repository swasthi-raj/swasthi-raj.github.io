  <h2>My Selected Dataset</h2>
  <p> SDRDL is a valuable local data hub full of socioeconomic datasets and tools for San Diego.I find it interesting to see the collections like <strong>Homelessness</strong>,<strong>Urban Planning</strong>, or <strong>Crime Data</strong>.</em>.</p>

  <h2>My Selected Data Science Book</h2>
  <p>An Introduction to Data Science by Jeffrey S. Saltz and Jeffrey M. Stanton is an easy-to-read, gentle introduction for people with a wide range of backgrounds into the world of data science. Needing no prior coding experience or a deep understanding of statistics, this book uses the R programming language and RStudioÂ® platform to make data science welcoming and accessible for all learners. After introducing the basics of data science, the book builds on each previous concept to explain R programming from the ground up. Readers will learn essential skills in data science through demonstrations of how to use data to construct models, predict outcomes, and visualize data.</p>
