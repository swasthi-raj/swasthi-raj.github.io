  <h2>My Selected Data Science Book</h2>
  <p>"Disruptive Possibilities: How Big Data Changes Everything" by Jeffrey Needham.The book took a new and complicated subject and made it easy for many people to understand. It also correctly predicted how data would change businesses and industries. Even now, it’s useful both as a beginner’s guide to big data and as a record of how people first started thinking about the data-driven future we live in today.</p>
